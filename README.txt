The exercise was coded using Python 3.5 and TensorFlow 1.13

The architecture, hyperparameters and data locations are all read from a single config file, so the python program (critters.py) only has one argument.

For further convenience, two command-line files are supplied:

- train_critters_full.cmd will train on the complete data set
- train_critters_quick.cmd will train on a (much) smaller subset, but completes a lot faster for quick evaluation and debugging of the code.

A screenshot of the output is provided for illustration.
